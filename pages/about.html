        <p>
          I'm Jubril Akolade, a computer programming student of Seneca College. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my life, I've been drawn to lesser-known wonders. My
          curiosity has led me to investigate little-known stories and stories
          that deserve attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          The inspiration for this platform came from my personal experiences of
          coming across breathtaking art pieces, groundbreaking scientific
          theories, captivating historical anecdotes, and cultural nuances that
          did not receive the attention that they truly deserved. There are a
          number of incredible accomplishments and creations that are obscured
          by the overwhelming noise of mainstream media. These hidden gems carry
          the potential to spark inspiration, broaden perspectives, and offer a
          fresh lens through which to view the world.
